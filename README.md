# RandomGamingOrigins
A basic Origins plugin that's heavily inspired and improves on the original origins skript of ZevOrigins.minehut.gg (Now rebranded as Minting.minehut.gg)

This plugin has been tested with:
Spigot 1.18 (Should work with multiple versions older and newer than this)
Spigot 1.19.3

If the plugin isn't working on your version trying changing the api-version in plugin.yml!

This plugin relies purely on the spigot API and thus should easily work on multiple Minecraft versions

Wanna try out this plugin for yourself? Try it out at Minting.minehut.gg!

To see all the commands check them out at https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/RandomGamingOrigins/blob/main/src/main/resources/plugin.yml!

Note: The goal of this plugin isn't to get as close to the Origins mod as possible, but to provide and nice, easy and balanced origins environment!
